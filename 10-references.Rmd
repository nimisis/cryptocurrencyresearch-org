## Document Format

The **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] was used to produce this document, which was built on top of **R Markdown** [@R-rmarkdown] and **knitr** [@R-knitr].

<!-- [TODO - ADJUST TO HAVE ONE FOR EACH ONE] -->

```{r write_bib_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c(.packages()), "packages.bib")
```
